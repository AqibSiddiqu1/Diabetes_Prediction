# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning with Python and Support Vector Machine Algorithm
The project is aimed at developing a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes.The project utilises various machine learning techniques, such as data preprocessing,Support Vector Machine, and model selection to develop an accurate and reliable diabetes prediction model.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.
You will also need to install the following Python packages:

1)NumPy
2)Pandas
3)Scikit-learn

**Data

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains information on females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes various features such as age, BMI, and blood pressure, and the target variable is a binary indicator of whether or not the individual developed diabetes.

The dataset is included in the project repository as a CSV file named diabetes.csv.

**Usage

To run the project, open the diabetes_prediction.ipynb Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.

**Results

The final SVM model achieved an accuracy of 77.27% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting diabetes in individuals at risk.

**Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request.
